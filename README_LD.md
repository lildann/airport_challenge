Evaluation
---------
• From the user stories and feature testing, identified Airport and Plane classes. (Initially identified Weather as a class and then altered this to a method within Airport class.)
• Identified methods take_off(plane) and land(plane) from the Airport class with one argument. 
• Altered read and write settings for the capacity of the airport.
• Created test for a random weather generator method, to output "Sunny" three times more likely than output "Stormy".
• Created 'guard clauses' for stormy weather when landing and taking off.
• Created 'guard clauses' if airport was at capacity or plane wasn't in the airport.
